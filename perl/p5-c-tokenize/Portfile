description         C::Tokenize - reduce a C file to a series of tokens

long_description    \
    The C::Tokenize module provides a tokenizer which breaks C source code into its \
    smallest meaningful components, and the regexes which match each of these \
    components. It also supplies regexes for local include statements and \
    C variables, as well as extra functions, such as for removing the comment \
    syntax of traditional C comments, and for removing all comments from a C program.
