description         Interact with TELNET port or other TCP ports
long_description    Net::Telnet allows you to make client connections to a \
                    TCP port and do network I/O, especially to a port using \
                    the TELNET protocol.  Simple I/O methods such as print, \
                    get, and getline are provided.  More sophisticated \
                    interactive features are provided because connecting to \
                    a TELNET port ultimately means communicating with a \
                    program designed for human interaction.  These \
                    interactive features include the ability to specify a \
                    time-out and to wait for patterns to appear in the input \
                    stream, such as the prompt from a shell.
