description         A tool for generating C-based recognizers from regular \
                    expressions.

long_description    re2c is a tool for generating C-based recognizers from \
                    regular expressions. re2c-based scanners are efficient: an \
                    re2c-based scanner is said to be typically almost twice as fast as \
                    a flex-based scanner with little or no increase in size.

# If future versions exhibit compile errors like

# "error: invalid operands to binary expression" (clang-3.4)
# with regard to ".rend()" it can possibly be fixed. See
# https://github.com/skvadrik/re2c/issues/198 for discussion and fix.
